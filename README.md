# Pomodoro-technique

This is the famous technique that helps people manage time and to get more stuff done. This is basically a very simple breakdown. Essentially, you figure out the task that you need to do something hard, something that takes a while like working, writing assignments, studying for exams or coding up a project.
And then you want to set your timer to the 25 minutes and then work on the task for 25 minutes. And then after that, you take a short five-minute break.
And after you've done four of these Pomodoros, basically four repetition, then you get to take a 15 to 30 minute break.
So this really effectively utilizes the way that our brain works to take short breaks often and to work for 25 minutes at a time, which helps us with information retention and also keeping up the motivation.
This project is built using tkinter. There's going to be a timer with a tomato on it. And when you click start, it's going to tell you to work for 25 minutes. Then that window can go into the background and while you're writing your code or doing whatever, when the timer's up, it will pop to the very front of the screen above all of the other windows and
tell you to take a break.
So the first break is for five minutes and you'll notice here, we've already achieved one check mark for our first Pomodoro completed.
And once you're done with the break, then it's going to go back to work and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click reset to stop and reset the timer. Effectively, it's going to help you do these Pomodoros where you have 25-minute work, 5-minute break. You do four of these 25-minute work sessions and then you get a 20-minute break.
